# Vue Combobox
## A simple, lightweight and full customizable component with no dependecies!

Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui).

This library is designed to be highly flexible and customizable. Each component within the library is slot-enabled, allowing users to seamlessly pass custom components based on their unique needs. This empowers developers to tailor the behavior and appearance of the components to suit various scenarios and requirements.

Unlike the 'shadcn' library component, this component doesn't require any additional sub-components. In the template, you can directly call the component.
